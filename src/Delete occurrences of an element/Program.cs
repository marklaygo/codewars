    // Alice and Bob were on a holiday.Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, 
    // and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. However, 
    // Charlie doesn't like this sessions, since the motive usually repeats.He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times.
    // He tells them that he will only sit during the session if they show the same motive at most N times.
    // Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motive as a number. 
    // Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times,
    // without changing the order?


    // Task
    // Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering.
    // For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take[1, 2, 3, 1, 2], drop the next[1, 2] 
    // since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3].

    // Example
    // Kata.DeleteNth (new int[] {20,37,20,21}, 1) // return [20,37,21]
    // Kata.DeleteNth(new int[] {1,1,3,3,7,2,2,2,2}, 3) // return [1, 1, 3, 3, 7, 2, 2, 2]

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", DeleteNth(new int[] { 20, 37, 20, 21 }, 1)));
        }

        // solution
        static int[] DeleteNth(int[] arr, int x)
        {
            var newList = new List<int>();

            foreach (var num in arr)
            {
                if (newList.Count(a => a == num) < x)
                    newList.Add(num);
            }
