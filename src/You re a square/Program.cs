    // A square of squares
    // You like building blocks.
    // You especially like building blocks that are squares.
    // And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
    // However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
    // Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
    // Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know,
    // whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! 
    // That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

    // Task
    // Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
    // In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;
    // in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
    // The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

    // Examples
    // Kata.isSquare(-1) // => false
    // Kata.isSquare( 3) // => false
    // Kata.isSquare( 4) // => true
    // Kata.isSquare(25) // => true
    // Kata.isSquare(26) // => false
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(IsSquare(-1));
        }

        // solution
        static bool IsSquare(int n)
        {
            return Math.Sqrt(n) % 1 == 0;
        }
    }
